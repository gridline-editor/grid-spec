This chapter discusses the data representation and structure of a Grid file on 
an object and file scope.

\section{Character Set}

Grid files, on an atomic level, are comprised of a sequence of 8-bit bytes. Its 
characater set is a subset of the American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange (ASCII). There are three classes of characters of which tokens are 
created from. They are: \textit{text}, \textit{delimiters}, and 
\textit{whitespace}. These classes apply to all characters in the character set 
with the exception of those within higher level entities; in such cases, 
separate rules apply.

\textit{Whitespace} characters (see Table \ref{tab:charset_ws}) separate contiguous \textit{tokens} that would 
otherwise combine to form a single token. Some 
Whitespace chatacters, \textit{newline characters} may additionally serve as 
markers denoting the end of a line.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Whitespace characters with their respective representations.}
    \label{tab:charset_ws}
    \begin{tabular*}{.8\linewidth}{
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l}
        Dec & Hex & Symbol & Name \\
        \hline
        09 & 09 & HT & Horizontal Tab \\
        10 & 0A & LF & Line Feed \\
        13 & 0D & CR & Carriage Return \\
        32 & 20 & SP & Space
    \end{tabular*}
\end{table}

When a Carriage Return character (CR) immediately preceeds a Line Feed 
character (LF), they are recognized as a single \textit{newline character} 
which indicates an End of Line (EOL) marker. By themselves, the CR and LF 
characters are also \textit{newline characters}. However, they do not not, by 
themselves, constitute an EOL marker.

\textit{Delimiter} characters (see Table \ref{tab:charset_dlm}) denote the start and end of a higher level entity 
such as a string or formula. Like whitespace characters, delimiter characters 
separate sequences of characters that will otherwise combine to form a token. 
Delimiters should be balanced such that every open delimeter has a 
corresponding closing delimeter of the same type. These characters are not to 
be included as part of the entities they terminate or instantiate.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Delimiter characters with their respective representations.}
    \label{tab:charset_dlm}
    \begin{tabular*}{.8\linewidth}{
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l}
        Dec & Hex & Symbol & Name \\
        \hline
        37 & 25 & \% & Percent Sign \\
        40 & 28 & ( & Open Parenthesis \\
        41 & 29 & ) & Close Parenthesis \\
        60 & 3C & < & Less Than \\
        62 & 3E & > & Greater Than \\
    \end{tabular*}
\end{table}

\textit{Text} characters are all characters except whitespace and delimiter 
characters. A sequence of contiguous text characters form a single token.
