\chapter{Syntax}

This chapter discusses the data representation and structure of a Grid file on an object and file scope.

\section{Character Set}

Grid files, on an atomic level, comprise a sequence of 8-bit bytes. Its character set is a subset of the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). There are three classes of characters: \preintroref{text}{}, \preintroref{delimiter}{s}, and whitespace. These classes apply to all characters in the character set except those within higher-level entities (see Section \ref{sec:tokens}); in such cases, separate rules apply.

Whitespace characters (see Table \ref{tab:charset_ws}) separate contiguous lexemes that would otherwise combine to form a single token. Some whitespace characters, may additionally serve as markers denoting the end of a line. Such characters are called newline characters.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Whitespace characters with their respective representations.}
    \label{tab:charset_ws}
    \begin{tabular*}{.8\linewidth}{
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l}
        Dec & Hex & Symbol & Name \\
        \hline
        09 & 09 & HT & Horizontal Tab \\
        10 & 0A & LF & Line Feed \\
        13 & 0D & CR & Carriage Return \\
        32 & 20 & SP & Space
    \end{tabular*}
\end{table}

When a Carriage Return character (CR) immediately precedes a Line Feed character (LF), it will be recognized as a single newline character, which indicates an End of Line (EOL) marker. By themselves, the CR and LF characters are also newline characters. However, they do not, by themselves, constitute an EOL marker.

\introref{Delimiter} characters (see Table \ref{tab:charset_dlm}) denote the start and end of a higher-level entity such as a string or formula. Like whitespace characters, \postintroref{delimiter}{} characters separate sequences of characters that will otherwise combine to form a token. \postintroref{Delimiter}{s} should be balanced such that every open \postintroref{delimiter}{} has a corresponding closing \postintroref{delimiter}{} of the same type. These characters are not part of the entities they terminate or instantiate.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Delimiter characters with their respective representations.}
    \label{tab:charset_dlm}
    \begin{tabular*}{.8\linewidth}{
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}
        l}
        Dec & Hex & Symbol & Name \\
        \hline
        37 & 25 & \% & Percent Sign \\
        40 & 28 & ( & Open Parenthesis \\
        41 & 29 & ) & Close Parenthesis \\
        60 & 3C & < & Less Than \\
        62 & 3E & > & Greater Than \\
    \end{tabular*}
\end{table}

\introref{Text}{} characters are all printable characters except whitespace and \postintroref{delimiter}{s}.
